This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with answers
("FAQ") may be translated into other languages, transformed into other
formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS), and updated with new
information.

   The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or an
approved translation, information on who is currently maintaining the
FAQ and how to contact them (including their e-mail address), and
information on where the latest version of the FAQ is archived
(including FTP information).

   The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

   [This version has been somewhat edited from the last-posted version
(as of August 1999) for inclusion in the Emacs distribution.]
